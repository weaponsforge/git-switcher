# git-switcher

The **git-switcher** repositoryÂ contains Windows batch scripts that offer easy switching between different Git global user account credentials, resetting the Git user's password for GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using two (2) options:

- Windows Credential Manager using `main-wincred.bat`
- A `~/.gitcredential` file using `main.bat`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.<br>
`git clone https://github.com/weaponsforge/git-switcher.git`

2. Select a Windows batch script to use: `main.bat` or `main-wincred.bat`.
   - Follow the GitBash Configuration Steps for from the preceeding sub-sections for a selected script.

3. Create a `.env` file following the pipe-delimited content format of the `.env.example` file to use with the **main-wincred.bat**. Replace its variables with actual values corresponding to Git accounts that you have access to. Create entries per line as many as needed.

   | Key | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | GIT_PROVIDER | Online Git provider. Possible values are: `github`, `gitlab` and `bitbucket` |
   | GIT_USERNAME | Git user name associated with the `GIT_PROVIDER` |
   | GIT_EMAIL | User email associated with the `GIT_USERNAME` |
   | GPG_KEY | (Optional) GPG signing key linked with the Git account.<br><br><blockquote>**INFO:** This option requires a GPG key linked and set-up with the Git account using the [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) software.</blockquote> |

4. Read the [Usage](#usage) section for reference on using the scripts after setting up GitBash from step **# 2**.

## GitBash Configuration (Windows OS only)

### GitBash Configuration with `main.bat`

Configure your GitBash first with the following settings before using the script.

> ***WARNING:** These settings remove the Windows Credential Manager process handling for Git to a text-based ".gitcredentials" file from an easy-to-access location. Proceed at your discretion.*

1. Open a command prompt as an **Administrator**  and run the command:<br>
`git config --global credential.helper "store --file ~/.gitcredential`
2. Delete your **github** access credentials from the **Windows Credentials Manager**.
   - Search for **Credential Manager** from the Search box.
	 - Click the **Windows Credentials** button.
	 - Find and delete the entry for **Github**, **Gitlab**, or **Bitbucket**
3. Run `git config --list --show-origin` to view updates.
   - Verify that the command created `.gitconfig` and `.gitcredential` files in **C:\Users\\[USER_NAME]**.
4. Step no.'s 1-3 have been tested for only **GitBash v2.33 - v2.36**. Do the following steps to ensure compatibility with GitBash versions higher than **v2.36+**.
5. Create a backup of the GitBash `gitconfig` file, usually found in the location:<br>
`C:\Program Files\Git\etc\gitconfig`
6. Edit the **gitconfig** file. Delete the following lines and SAVE. (You may need Administrator access to edit the file).<br>
   ```
   [credential]
	   helper = manager
   ```
   - Restore the deleted lines anytime as needed.
   - Take note the git-switcher script will not work after restoring the deleted lines.

### GitBash Configuration with `main-wincred.bat`

1. GitBash requires no further setup when using the Windows Credential Manager for managing Git accounts.
2. Undo the GitBash setup steps from [GitBash Configuration with `main.bat`](#gitbash-configuration-with-mainbat), if these steps were previously used.

## Usage

> **INFO:** `main-wincred.bat` requires Git user accounts data set in a `.env` file.
